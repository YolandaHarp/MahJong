info=After launching the game, we enter a beautiful main interface. In the middle part of the main interface, you can select the game language. The bottom right corner has the exit game button. In the middle of the page, there are three buttons made of Mahjong tiles, representing the three modes of the game.\r\n\r\nThe leftmost is the local mode. If you want to create a game room, choose the middle mode. Other three players need to enter your IP address in the right mode to join the room and play.\r\n\r\nAfter entering the game, during your turn, you can double-click on one of your hand cards to play it. The newly drawn cards from the deck each round will be placed on the far right of your hand. If your hand cards can perform operations such as chow, pong, kong,or win, corresponding buttons will appear above your hand cards. You just need to click on the relevant button.\r\n\r\nThe number of remaining cards is displayed in the top left corner of the screen, and the indicator card for this round is shown in the top right corner. This means that the next card after the indicator card is wild (the next card after nine is the first suit of the same color, and the order of character cards is a cycle of south, east, north, west, and a cycle of zhong, fa, and bai).\r\n\r\nYour turn will indicate on the left that this is your turn, and the player number currently in progress will turn orange.\r\n\r\nIf more than one player wins at the same time, the player who plays the cards in the first order wins.\r\n\r\nA more detailed introduction to Mahjong will be in the doc file outside the game.
